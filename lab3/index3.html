        <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
        <p>This lab required us to strengthen the local files on our computers and to add index.html files. 
            </p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>At first, it was challenging to focus on this lab. We realized we were hungry and got some food and then we were able to focus. Then we had trouble getting our image to appear on task 3. </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>We successfully created an index.html file within a file structure.</p>
